# Study Experiments

- **This is where all my studied codes went**

All kind of experiments with code including "legacy" web, ruby, python or all kinds of languages that didn't really need an isolated repo for it.

The Web scope will have snippets from codes HTML/CSS/JS that i've learned to do from Web Courses/Events and from my college (1st).

## Deploys or Codes

- **Python:** [src/python/README.md](src/python/)
- **Ruby:** [src/ruby/README.md](src/ruby/)
